I hold a PhD titled "[Learning the Audiovisual Representation of Speech Applied to Emotion Recognition](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04617104v1)" and currently work as a Postdoctoral Researcher at INRIA Grenoble under the supervision of Xavier Al-Merida.

My research focuses on multimodal generative models for audiovisual speech. I aim to develop interpretable generative models to enhance data analysis, control, and generation.
